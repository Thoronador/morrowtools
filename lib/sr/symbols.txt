List of preprocessor symbols used in SRTP:
==========================================

SR_NO_SINGLETON_EQUALITY_CHECK - if defined, the record manager singletons
                                 (currently only MapBasedRecordManager) will not
                                 check for equal records when reading a new
                                 record via readNextRecord() functions.
                                 This can be used when only reading a single ESM
                                 file or files with contents that do not
                                 "overlap".

SR_NO_RECORD_EQUALITY          - This symbol removes the equalsBasic() function
                                 from BasicRecord and removes the equals()
                                 functions from all derived record types.
                                 Additionally, it has the same effect as
                                 SR_NO_SINGLETON_EQUALITY_CHECK on record
                                 manager singletons.

SR_UNSAVEABLE_RECORDS         - This symbol removes the saveToStream() and
                                getWriteSize() functions from BasicRecord and
                                all its derived classes. As a consequence it
                                strips the ability to save records from all
                                record manager singletons.
                                Useful if a programme just wants to read ESMs
                                but never save any ESM data.
