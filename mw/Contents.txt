- base         - This directory contains the source code for stuff that could
                 be used in other programmes of morrowtools, too. However,
                 there are no other programmes besides spell_rename yet.

- spell_rename - directory containing files specific to the spell renamer
                 programme

- Contents.txt - this file, you're reading it right now

- GPL.txt      - Full text of the GNU General Public License version 3 as
                 published by the Free Software Foundation.

Within some directories you may find files named TODO or ToDo.txt. These files
list some of the work that still has to be done for that specific directory.
