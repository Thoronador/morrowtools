List of things that should be done for spell_rename sooner or later:

To do:
======
  - allow to read a customized list of master and plugin files and not just
    the standard files (Morrowind.esm, Tribunal.esm, Bloodmoon.esm)
  - [IMPORTANT] write some documentation that's easy to understand
  - [Wishlist] graphical wrapper application
