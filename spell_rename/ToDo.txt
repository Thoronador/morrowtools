List of things that should be done for spell_rename sooner or later:

To do:
======
  - automatically detect plugin files that do not contain any relevant data,
    i.e. spells, magic effects or GMSTs
  - [IMPORTANT] write some documentation that's easy to understand
  - [Wishlist] graphical wrapper application
