# GUI for formID_finder

This directory contains the source code for the GUI to the formID_finder
command-line program.

## Building from source

Contrary to the other programs, the GUI is written in ObjectPascal. Therefore,
the required tools are different.

### Prerequisites

To build the GUI from source you need the FreePascal compiler and the Lazarus
IDE. Any not completely outdated version of these tools should do the job, e. g.
FreePascal 2.6+ and Lazarus 1.x+ should be "recent" enough.

All of that can usually be installed be typing

    apt-get install fp-compiler lazarus 

or

    yum install lazarus

into a root terminal.

### Build process

_[work in progress]_

The build process is relatively easy, just open the Lazarus project file from
this directory in the Lazarus IDE. Then hit F9 (the default shortcut for start
of the project).
