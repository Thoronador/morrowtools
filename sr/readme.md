# Skyrim-related tools

This directory and its subdirectories contain the code for Skyrim-related tools.

There are the following directories:

* **base**: general classes and code for Skyrim's data format
* **bsa_cli**: code for `bsa-cli`, a command-line interface for BSA archives of
  Skyrim
* **conv_cams**: _(obsolete)_ tool to convert CAMS records in an ESM file to the
  pre-1.5 patch state
* **formID_finder**: command-line interface to search for form IDs in Skyrim
* **formID_finder_GUI**: a GUI that wraps `formID_finder` calls in a more
  user-friendly way
* **small_high_elves**: _(just for fun)_ command-line tool that creates a Skyrim
  plugin which adjusts the size of high elves to be not so high anymore
